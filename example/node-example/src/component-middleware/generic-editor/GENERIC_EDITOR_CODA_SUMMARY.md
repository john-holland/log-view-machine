## üìã Coda Structure

### Context Responses
The coda includes specialized context responses for common editor issues:

#### Performance Issues
- Profile zoom/pan system for bottlenecks
- Check state machine transitions for optimization
- Consider debouncing canvas updates
- Analyze flexbox layout performance

#### Layout Issues
- Check flexbox layout structure

- Test responsive design breakpoints
- Check for conflicting CSS rules

#### State Machine Issues
- Trace through state machine transitions
- Check event handling logic
- Verify mouse enter/leave handlers
- Debug zoom/pan state management

### Narrative Templates
Customized narrative templates for editor-specific development:

#### Problem Start
- Analyze editor issues systematically
- Understand component structure and requirements
- Break down into manageable sub-components

#### Optimization Start
- Optimize editor performance
- Look for state machine optimizations
- Analyze canvas rendering bottlenecks

#### Layout Implementation
- Implement layouts using modern CSS techniques
- Start with flexbox for side panels
- Ensure responsive design works across devices

## üèóÔ∏è Specialized Sections

### 1. **Editor Architecture**

  - What user action triggered this state?
  - How should the state transition?
  - What debugging information is available?
  - Is the state machine in a consistent state?

### 3. **Layout System**
- **Focus**: Flexbox, CSS Grid, responsive breakpoints, consistent spacing
- **Key Questions**:
  - What layout system should I use?
  - How does this affect responsive design?
  - Are there any layout conflicts?
  - How should I handle spacing and alignment?

### 4. **Component Development**
- **Focus**: Component lifecycle, event handling, state management
- **Key Questions**:
  - What is the component lifecycle?
  - How should events be handled?
  - What state does this component manage?

### 5. **Performance Optimization**
- **Focus**: Profiling, debouncing, canvas rendering, DOM manipulation
- **Key Questions**:
  - What is the performance bottleneck?
  - How can I reduce unnecessary updates?
  - What can be debounced or throttled?
  - How can I optimize the rendering pipeline?

### 6. **Debugging Strategy**
- **Focus**: Console logging, state machine debugging, responsive design testing
- **Key Questions**:
  - What is the current state machine state?
  - Are events being handled correctly?
  - Is the layout rendering properly?
  - What debugging tools are available?

### 7. **Responsive Design**
- **Focus**: Cross-device testing, touch interactions, breakpoints, consistent UX
- **Key Questions**:
  - How does this work on mobile?
  - Are touch interactions optimized?
  - Do breakpoints work correctly?
  - Is the UX consistent across devices?
